\subsection{Theoretical Framework: Addressing the Ultra-Precision Challenge}

Our methodology represents a fundamental breakthrough in achieving ultra-precision solutions for fourth-order PDEs, directly addressing the critical gaps identified in existing PINN approaches. While standard PINNs plateau at relative errors of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-6}$ \cite{vahab2022physics,kapoor2023physics}, our hybrid Fourier-neural architecture breaks through this precision ceiling by synergistically combining analytical insights with adaptive learning.

The core innovation lies in recognizing that the precision limitations of standard PINNs stem from three fundamental issues: (1) numerical instabilities in computing fourth-order derivatives through automatic differentiation \cite{hu2024hutchinson}, (2) the inability of generic neural architectures to efficiently represent oscillatory solutions \cite{brunton2024machine}, and (3) the competing objectives in physics-informed loss functions that create complex optimization landscapes \cite{wang2021understanding,krishnapriyan2021characterizing}. Our approach systematically addresses each of these challenges through architectural innovations and novel training strategies.

\subsection{Assumptions and Justification}

Our breakthrough approach allows us to relax several restrictive assumptions while introducing targeted ones that enable ultra-precision:

\textbf{Assumption 1: The solution admits a dominant modal decomposition with bounded residuals.}
Unlike methods that assume purely neural representations, we leverage the physical insight that beam vibrations naturally decompose into harmonic modes \cite{han1999dynamics}. This allows explicit separation of dominant periodic behavior from fine-scale corrections, dramatically improving optimization efficiency.

\textbf{Assumption 2: Optimal harmonic truncation exists for ultra-precision.}
Through systematic investigation, we discovered that truncation at exactly 10 harmonics provides optimal balance between expressiveness and optimization tractability. This counterintuitive finding—that more harmonics degrade performance—represents a key insight for achieving ultra-precision.

\textbf{Assumption 3: Two-phase optimization can navigate precision barriers.}
We assume the loss landscape exhibits a hierarchical structure where gradient-based methods efficiently reach moderate precision ($\sim 10^{-5}$), while quasi-Newton methods are necessary to breach the ultra-precision barrier ($< 10^{-7}$). This motivates our Adam-to-L-BFGS transition strategy.

\subsection{Hybrid Fourier-Neural Architecture: The Breakthrough Design}

Our hybrid architecture represents a paradigm shift from existing PINN approaches, specifically engineered to overcome the precision barriers that limit standard methods. Unlike previous attempts that either use purely neural representations \cite{raissi2019physics} or simple activation function modifications \cite{wong2022learning}, our approach fundamentally restructures the solution representation to exploit the physical structure of beam vibrations.

The breakthrough formulation explicitly separates modal and non-modal components:

\begin{equation}
w(t,x) = \underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^{N} \left[a_n \cos(\omega_n t) + b_n \sin(\omega_n t)\right] \sin(k_n x)}_{\text{Dominant modal behavior (Fourier)}} + \underbrace{\lambda \cdot \mathcal{N}(t,x)}_{\text{Fine-scale corrections (Neural)}}
\label{eq:hybrid_solution}
\end{equation}

This separation addresses multiple gaps simultaneously:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gap 1 - Precision Ceiling}: The Fourier basis provides near-exact representation of dominant modes, reducing the burden on neural approximation
    \item \textbf{Gap 2 - Fourth-Order Derivatives}: Analytical differentiation of Fourier terms eliminates numerical instabilities
    \item \textbf{Gap 3 - Optimization Complexity}: Separate optimization paths for Fourier coefficients and neural weights simplify the loss landscape
\end{itemize}

The first term leverages the known modal structure of beam equations, automatically satisfying boundary conditions $w(t,0) = w(t,L) = 0$ through the $\sin(k_n x)$ basis. Crucially, our discovery that $N=10$ harmonics optimizes performance contradicts the intuition that more basis functions improve accuracy—a finding that stems from the interplay between expressiveness and optimization difficulty in the ultra-precision regime.

The neural network $\mathcal{N}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is designed with the following architecture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input layer: $(t, x) \in [0, T] \times [0, L]$
    \item Hidden layers: $2 \rightarrow 128 \rightarrow 128 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 1$
    \item Activation: Hyperbolic tangent (tanh) for smooth derivatives
    \item Total parameters: 27,905 for neural network + 130 Fourier coefficients
\end{itemize}

To ensure boundary condition satisfaction, the neural correction is modulated by:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_{\text{BC}}(t,x) = \mathcal{N}(t,x) \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{Hybrid Fourier-PINN architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation showing both forward pass (solid arrows) and backward propagation (dashed arrows). The architecture combines a truncated Fourier series expansion (10 harmonics) with a 7-layer deep neural network (2→128→128→64→32→16→8→1 neurons). The Fourier coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$ are learnable parameters trained through backpropagation, not outputs from the neural network. Boundary conditions are enforced through multiplication with $\sin(\pi x/L)$. The two-phase optimization strategy achieves L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the detailed architecture of our hybrid approach. The input coordinates $(t,x)$ feed into both the Fourier series expansion and the neural correction network. A critical aspect of our architecture is that the Fourier coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$ are \textit{independent learnable parameters}, not outputs from the neural network. 

The training mechanism operates as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Combined Output Formation}: The loss is computed from the combined output of both branches. The Fourier series output (utilizing learnable parameters $A_n, B_n$) and the neural network output are summed to produce the complete solution, which is then used to calculate the physics-informed loss.
    
    \item \textbf{Backward Propagation Flow}: During backpropagation, gradients flow through the entire model architecture. Starting from the physics-informed loss, gradients reach the combination block where the two branches merge. From this point, the gradient flow splits into two independent paths: one flowing to the Fourier series branch (updating $A_n, B_n$) and another to the deep neural network branch (updating the network weights).
    
    \item \textbf{Simultaneous Training}: Both branches undergo training simultaneously but independently. The Fourier coefficients $A_n, B_n$ receive gradients directly from the loss function through their contribution to the solution, while the neural network weights receive gradients through their own computational path. This parallel training enables each component to specialize—the Fourier series captures dominant periodic behavior while the neural network learns fine corrections.
    
    \item \textbf{Independence of Parameters}: It is crucial to understand that while $A_n$ and $B_n$ are updated through backpropagation, they are neither learned from nor produced by the deep neural network. They constitute separate learnable parameters that receive their own gradients directly from the loss function.
    
    \item \textbf{Architectural Summary}: The key insight is that $A_n$ and $B_n$ are learnable parameters trained simultaneously with, but independently from, the neural network. The neural network does not produce or determine these coefficients. Both branches contribute to the final solution and both receive gradients from the loss, enabling a powerful synergy that achieves ultra-precision through specialized yet complementary learning.
\end{enumerate}

The mathematical implementation explicitly defines these coefficients as trainable parameters:
\begin{equation}
A_n, B_n \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{for} \quad n = 1, 2, \ldots, 10
\end{equation}
initialized with small random values scaled by $1/(n+1)$. During training, the optimizer updates both sets of parameters:
\begin{align}
A_n^{(k+1)} &= A_n^{(k)} - \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_n} \\
B_n^{(k+1)} &= B_n^{(k)} - \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial B_n} \\
\mathbf{W}_{NN}^{(k+1)} &= \mathbf{W}_{NN}^{(k)} - \eta \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{W}_{NN}}
\end{align}
where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $\mathbf{W}_{NN}$ represents the neural network weights. This simultaneous but independent optimization is key to achieving ultra-precision, as it prevents coupling between the frequency-domain representation and the spatial correction mechanism.

\subsection{Physics-Informed Loss Function with Adaptive Weighting}

The Euler-Bernoulli beam equation governs the transverse vibration:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + c^2 \frac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4} = 0
\label{eq:euler_bernoulli}
\end{equation}

Our breakthrough in loss function design addresses the critical gap of fixed weighting strategies that plague standard PINNs \cite{mcclenny2023self}. We introduce a sophisticated adaptive weighting mechanism that dynamically balances competing objectives:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = w_{\text{pde}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{pde}} + w_{\text{ic}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{ic}} + w_{\text{ic}_t} \mathcal{L}_{\text{ic}_t} + w_{\text{bc}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{bc}} + \lambda_{\text{reg}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}}
\end{equation}

The key innovation is that weights $w_{\alpha}$ are not fixed but dynamically adjusted based on the loss landscape topology, preventing any single term from dominating and enabling navigation to ultra-precision solutions.

where:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{pde}} &= \frac{1}{N_{\text{pde}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{pde}}} \left|\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2} + c^2 \frac{\partial^4 w}{\partial x^4}\right|^2 \\
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ic}} &= \frac{1}{N_{\text{ic}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{ic}}} |w(0, x_i) - w_0(x_i)|^2 \\
\mathcal{L}_{\text{ic}_t} &= \frac{1}{N_{\text{ic}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{ic}}} \left|\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}(0, x_i) - v_0(x_i)\right|^2 \\
\mathcal{L}_{\text{bc}} &= \frac{1}{N_{\text{bc}}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{bc}}} \left[|w(t_i, 0)|^2 + |w(t_i, L)|^2\right]
\end{align}

The adaptive weight balancing strategy \cite{wang2021understanding,mcclenny2020self} employs:
\begin{equation}
w_{\alpha} = \frac{\text{scale}}{1 + \exp(-\log_{10}(\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}))}
\end{equation}
where scale = $1.0 + \frac{N}{130}$ accounts for harmonic complexity.

\subsection{Two-Phase Optimization Strategy: Breaking the Precision Barrier}

Our two-phase optimization represents a fundamental breakthrough in training PINNs for ultra-precision, directly addressing the gap where single-optimizer strategies plateau at moderate accuracy \cite{penwarden2023unified}. The key insight is recognizing that the journey from initial guess to ultra-precision requires fundamentally different optimization characteristics at different precision scales:

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/workflow_diagram.png}
    \caption{Training workflow and optimization strategy for the ultra-precision PINN. The methodology employs a two-phase approach: initial Adam optimization for rapid convergence followed by L-BFGS refinement for ultra-high precision. Dynamic memory management and adaptive weight balancing ensure stable training throughout both phases.}
    \label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Phase 1: Adam Optimization (2000 iterations)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial learning rate: 0.01 with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler \cite{kingma2014adam}
    \item Gradient clipping: max\_norm = 1.0 to prevent instabilities
    \item Dynamic batch sizing based on available GPU memory (95\% utilization)
    \item Early stopping if loss plateaus for 200 iterations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 2: L-BFGS Refinement (5000 iterations)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quasi-Newton method for high-precision convergence \cite{liu1989limited}
    \item Full-batch optimization for accurate Hessian approximation
    \item Line search with strong Wolfe conditions
    \item Convergence tolerance: $10^{-9}$ for gradient norm
\end{itemize}

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{GPU-Efficient Implementation}

Addressing the computational efficiency gap identified in existing PINNs \cite{jagtap2020conservative}, we developed custom GPU kernels specifically optimized for fourth-order derivative computations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fused Operations}: Combined forward passes and derivative calculations in single kernel calls, reducing memory bandwidth by 60\%
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Memory Management}: Adaptive batch sizing based on available GPU memory (95\% utilization target)
    \item \textbf{Gradient Checkpointing}: Strategic recomputation during backpropagation to handle large computational graphs
    \item \textbf{Mixed Precision}: FP32 for critical accumulations, FP16 for intermediate calculations where precision permits
\end{itemize}

These optimizations enable training with up to $10^6$ collocation points on a single GPU, crucial for achieving ultra-precision through dense sampling of the solution domain.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis and Harmonic Discovery}

To understand the model's behavior with respect to harmonic count, we conducted extensive sensitivity analysis \cite{psaros2023uncertainty}, leading to our breakthrough discovery:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Harmonic Truncation Analysis}: Systematically varied $N$ from 5 to 50 harmonics, revealing optimal performance at $N=10$ with L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$.
    
    \item \textbf{Memory-Performance Trade-off}: Higher harmonic counts require larger memory footprints, with GPU memory usage scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N \times B)$ where $B$ is batch size.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimization Landscape Complexity}: The loss landscape becomes increasingly non-convex with more harmonics, explaining the degraded performance beyond $N=15$.
\end{enumerate}

The sensitivity results indicate that the optimal configuration balances expressiveness with optimization tractability, achieving unprecedented precision through careful architectural design rather than brute-force parameter scaling.
