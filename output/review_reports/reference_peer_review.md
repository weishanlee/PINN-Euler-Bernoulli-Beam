## Correctable Metadata Errors  
| Key | Issue | Suggested Fix |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| `pang2020fPINNs` | Year listed as **2019** but volume 41(4) corresponds to **2020** | Change `year` to `2020`. |
| `wong2022learning` | Title year 2022 vs journal volume 5(6) → **IEEE TAI 2024** | Update `year` → `2024`; check pages after final publication. |
| `vahab2022physics` | Journal uses article number `04021139`; add DOI `10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0001994`. |
| `li2020fourier` | Add conference info: *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (NeurIPS 2020)* and DOI `10.48550/arXiv.2010.08895`. |
| `kingma2014adam` | Change `booktitle` to *International Conference on Learning Representations* **(ICLR 2015)**; add URL `https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980`. |
| `liu1989limited` | Add DOI `10.1007/BF01589116`. |

## Verdict Summary  
✔ Accurate: 29  △ Correctable: 6  ✗ Fake: 4  **Action Required**: Replace fake entries; patch metadata for correctable ones.

> **Next Step**  
> • Remove the four fake references and insert the two replacements above (or other genuine works).  
> • Apply metadata fixes listed in the table.  
> • Re-run verification before final compilation.
