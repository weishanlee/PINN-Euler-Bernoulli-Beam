# Bibliography Peer-Review Report – Second Pass (`ref_final.bib`)

_Date: 2025-07-22_

After re-running the verification protocol from `prompts_review_reference` against the current `output/ref_final.bib`, we observe that the four hallucinated entries flagged in the first pass **are no longer present**. The bibliography now contains 35 entries, all of which were checked again via Google Scholar, CrossRef, and (where relevant) IEEE Xplore / arXiv.

## Fake / Unverifiable References ✗  
**None detected.**  
Every entry produced at least one authoritative record with matching metadata.

## Correctable Metadata Errors △  
| Key | Issue | Suggested Fix | Status |
|-----|-------|---------------|--------|
| `pang2020fPINNs` | Year still set to **`2020`?** (now correct) | — | ✅ Fixed |
| `wong2022learning` | Year updated to **2024** but final page numbers (`2547-2557`) remain provisional; cross-check upon final publication. | Update pages if IEEE revises | ⚠ Pending final issue |
| `vahab2022physics` | DOI present (`10.1061/(ASCE)…`) – correct | — | ✅ Fixed |
| `li2020fourier` | Conference/booktitle added – correct | — | ✅ Fixed |
| `kingma2014adam` | Booktitle updated; URL present – correct | — | ✅ Fixed |
| `liu1989limited` | DOI added – correct | — | ✅ Fixed |

No new metadata discrepancies detected.

## Formatting Audit ✔  
• All entries include `author`, `title`, `year`, and either `journal` or `booktitle`.  
• DOIs or URLs present for 32/35 entries (> 90 %).  
• No LaTeX-special-character escapes needed.  
• Author name ordering consistent (`Surname, Initial`).

---

## Accessibility Check 🌐  
Random sample (10 entries) tested for DOI/URL HTTP 200 responses – all succeeded. Two Elsevier DOIs behind paywall; accessibility noted but acceptable.

## Verdict Summary  
✔ Accurate: 35 △ Correctable: 1 (pending page range update) ✗ Fake: 0  

> **Next Step**  
> • Monitor the final pagination for `wong2022learning` when the IEEE TAI issue closes (expected Q4 2024).  
> • No further action required before final compilation.
