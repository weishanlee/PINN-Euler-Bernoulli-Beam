# Peer-Review Report – Methods Section (v6)  
*Using updated `prompts_review_methods` – July 2025*

_Date reviewed: 2025-07-22_

## 1  Executive Summary  
The Methods section presents a hybrid Fourier-Neural PINN architecture with a two-phase optimisation strategy aimed at “ultra-precision” solutions of the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation. The revised v6 draft shows substantial improvements in reproducibility, explicit notation, and alignment with previously identified research gaps. Remaining issues are limited to empirical justification of certain hyper-parameters, explicit code–equation traceability, and a few citation-style inconsistencies.

## 2  Major Concerns (rank-ordered)

| ID | Checklist Tag | Issue | Impact | Recommendation |
|----|---------------|-------|--------|----------------|
| M1 | **Reproducibility – Hyper-Parameters** | The batch-size formula and the adaptive-weight constant (130) lack quantitative evidence (tuning curves, ablation study). | High | Add a short appendix or figure presenting sensitivity curves for batch size and the 130 constant; cite specific experiments backing the choice. |
| M2 | **Code Alignment** | GPU kernel reference (file & lines) is helpful but no repository link or checksum is provided. | High | Release kernels in a public repo (or supplementary zip) and cite commit hash to ensure verifiability. |
| M3 | **Assumptions vs Findings** | ‘Assumption 2’ in v5 has correctly moved to the Sensitivity section, but the narrative still refers to it as an “assumption” once. | Medium | Change wording to “Finding 1” consistently. |
| M4 | **Citation Balance** | Section now contains 14 citations: 9 information-prominent, 5 author-prominent. The updated prompt requires near-alternation; two adjacent information-prominent citations appear (lines 38-40). | Medium | Rephrase one citation to author-prominent (e.g., “**Karniadakis et al.** [XX] recently …”). |
| M5 | **Equation-Algorithm Traceability** | Algorithm 1 updates `$A_n`, `$B_n` using SGD while neural weights use Adam, yet Eq. (18) implies a unified learning rate. | Medium | Clarify in text or use same optimiser; otherwise, justify mixed strategy. |

## 3  Minor Concerns
1. **Figure 1 caption** should state *numeric* L2 error rather than “ultra-precision”.  
2. **Table 1 order**: place `FP16`, `FP32` after mathematical symbols to keep physical constants grouped.  
3. **Equation numbering drift**: Eq. (5) referenced as Eq. (4) in one sentence.  
4. **Placeholder variable `N_params`** still undefined in batch-size formula footnote.  
5. **Typos**: duplicate phrase “non-modal” twice in paragraph 4.

## 4  Verification of Prompt-Specific Requirements
| Prompt Requirement | Status |
|--------------------|--------|
| Clear articulation of how gaps from `research_gaps_analysis.md` are addressed | ✔ Present (Section 2) |
| Workflow diagram included & referenced | ✔ Figure 2 present |
| Sensitivity analysis description & visual evidence | △ Textual description only; no plot |
| GPU efficiency discussion linked to code | △ File & line numbers given; no public repo |
| Citation-style alternation (author- vs info-prominent) | △ Minor imbalance (see M4) |
| LaTeX package header comment present | ✔ Included |
| Section review checklist at end | ✔ Present & updated |

## 5  Actionable Recommendations
1. **Add empirical justification** for batch-size heuristic and adaptive-weight constant (plots or table).  
2. **Publish GPU kernels** (GitHub or supplementary) and reference commit hash.  
3. **Ensure citation alternation**; convert at least one information-prominent citation to author-prominent.  
4. **Fix minor wording & numbering issues** (M3, Minor #3–5).  
5. **Consider unifying optimisers** or justify the mixed strategy explicitly.

## 6  Verdict Flags
✔ Accurate & Substantive – The methodology is conceptually strong.  
△ Correctable – Empirical evidence & citation balance need minor revisions.  
✗ None – No major flaws or unverifiable claims detected.

> **Overall Recommendation:** *Minor Revision.* Address the listed corrections and provide empirical backing for hyper-parameters to achieve full compliance with the updated methods-review prompt.
