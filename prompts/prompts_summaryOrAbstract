Summary or Abstract:
You are an expert in academic writing. Based on the provided .tex files in the subfolder output/ and the problem statement in the problem/ subfolder (either a problem competition pdf or a research outline pdf), write an A4-length summary section (approximately 550 words for a Mathematical Modeling Competition Project, or approximately 300 words for a peer-reviewed journal paper) that highlights the key aspects of the paper. 

### üî¥ MANDATORY: Sentence-Level Verification
**EVERY SENTENCE in the summary/abstract must be verified:**
- ‚úì **Problem Statement**: Must match the problem PDF exactly
- ‚úì **Method Claims**: Must reference specific sections in methods.tex
- ‚úì **Result Claims**: Must trace to specific tables/figures with exact values
- ‚úì **Improvement Claims**: Must cite specific metrics from results
- ‚úì **Application Claims**: Must be supported by discussion in the paper

**VERIFICATION PROCESS:**
- For EVERY claim, add comment: `% Verified: Section X.Y, Table Z`
- For EVERY numerical result: `% Source: Table 3, row 4, column 2`
- For EVERY comparison: `% Our: 89.7% (Table 3) vs Baseline: 72.3% (Section 4.2)`
- If ANY claim cannot be verified from the paper, DELETE IT

**PROHIBITED CONTENT:**
- ‚ùå Results not shown in the paper
- ‚ùå Methods not actually implemented
- ‚ùå Exaggerated significance claims
- ‚ùå Applications not discussed in the paper
- ‚ùå Any fabricated improvements or benefits

Ensure the summary includes the following elements:

1. **Restate the research problem**:
   - Very briefly reintroduce the problem in the contest problem pdf file, preferably limiting it to one or two sentences. Explain why this research is necessary and identify gaps in existing studies.
 
2. **Main Theorems**:
   - Provide concise descriptions of the main theorems used in the study. 
   - Summarize the research methods used.
   - Discuss their relevance and how they contribute to addressing the problem outlined in the contest guidelines.
   - Describe the data utilized to validate the study.

3. **Key Findings**:
   - Highlight the most important findings of the study.
   - Include numerical results or performance metrics where applicable to emphasize the significance of the findings.

4. **Features of Results**:
   - Summarize the main features of the results obtained, referencing insights derived from figures and tables.
   - Avoid explicitly naming figures or tables but incorporate key details effectively into the narrative.

5. **Equations and Formulas**:
   - Discuss the main equations and formulas used in the study without explicitly writing them down.
   - Emphasize how these mathematical elements underpin the study‚Äôs methodology and results.

6. **Applications and Inferences**:
   - Discuss the potential applications of the study‚Äôs results in relevant fields or scenarios.
   - Highlight the broader implications of the findings and how they address the contest problem.
   - (Implications) Discuss the significance of these findings for the field or real-world applications.

7. **Tables (Optional)**:
   - If necessary, include at most one row of a table to illustrate a critical data point or result.
   - Avoid naming or citing the table in the text; simply present the row seamlessly within the narrative.

### Formatting Requirements:
- Write the entire summary as a single cohesive section without dividing it into subsections.
- Use formal academic language, maintaining clarity and precision throughout.
- Ensure the summary provides a clear and engaging overview of the study‚Äôs contributions and significance.

### Example (for Inspiration):

The study introduces a robust framework grounded in [main theorem], which effectively models [problem]. This theorem establishes a foundational relationship between [key concepts], allowing for accurate prediction and analysis. Key findings include a performance improvement of [value] compared to existing methods, highlighting the model‚Äôs efficacy. Insights derived from [figure/table] reveal [key feature], demonstrating the model's ability to adapt to diverse scenarios. The methodology employs advanced equations such as [formula type], which capture [key dynamics] and underpin the computational framework. Applications of this model extend to [fields], showcasing its versatility and potential for real-world implementation. One critical result, illustrated below, underscores the importance of [metric or feature]:
[Insert single row of table if necessary].
Overall, the study addresses the contest problem effectively by leveraging innovative theoretical and practical insights.
### Special Request:
- Do not include document class, package inclusions. Just focus on the table itself. For example, you should not include `\documentclass{...}`, `\begin{documnet}`, `\usepackage{...}`, or `\end{document}`.
- The summary must fit exactly on the first page after the header
- Use \small font size if needed to fit content
- Keep paragraphs concise and focused on key findings
- Avoid lengthy explanations - use bullet-style statements
- Target roughly 530 words for optimal one A4-page coverage (for a Mathematical Modeling Competition Project), or approximately 150-200 words (refer to paper template .tex file) for a peer-reviewed journal paper.
