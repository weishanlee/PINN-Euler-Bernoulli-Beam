Conclusions:
Prompt:
You are an expert on writing a paper. Based on the provided .tex files in the subfolder output/ and the problem statement in the problem/ subfolder (either a problem competition pdf or a research outline pdf), write an A4-page long (roughly 500 words) conclusion in LaTeX format summarizing our study. Follow these instructions:

### üî¥ MANDATORY: Sentence-Level Verification for Conclusions
**EVERY SENTENCE in this section must be verified:**
- ‚úì **Summary Claims**: Must reference specific results from earlier sections
- ‚úì **Contribution Statements**: Must trace to demonstrated improvements
- ‚úì **Comparison Claims**: Must cite specific prior work and quantified differences
- ‚úì **Future Work**: Must logically extend from current limitations
- ‚úì **Application Claims**: Must be supported by results shown

**VERIFICATION PROCESS:**
- For EVERY conclusion, add comment: `% Based on: Section X.Y, Table Z`
- For EVERY comparison: `% Our method: 89.7% (Table 3) vs Prior: 72.3% [cite]`
- For EVERY claim of novelty: `% Innovation: [specific advance demonstrated in Methods]`
- If claim not supported by earlier sections, DELETE IT

**PROHIBITED CONTENT:**
- ‚ùå Claims not backed by presented results
- ‚ùå Exaggerated impact statements
- ‚ùå Future work that ignores stated limitations
- ‚ùå Comparisons without specific numbers
- ‚ùå New results not shown earlier
- ‚ùå Overgeneralized conclusions

### Content Requirements:
1. **Highlight Key Findings**:
   - Summarize the most important findings of the current study.
   - Use specific numerical results or metrics where appropriate to emphasize the study's contributions.
   - (Implications)Discuss the contribution and significance of the findings.

2. **Main Features**:
   - Discuss the primary features of the study, including methodologies, models, or frameworks, with quantitative details where applicable.

3. **Applications**:
   - Explore the potential applications of the model developed in the study to other scenarios or cases.
   - (Future work) Suggest potential directions for further research.

4. **Comparison with Literature**:
   - Compare the results of the current study with existing findings in the literature.
   - Highlight areas where the study aligns with or diverges from previous work.

5.**Limitations**: 
   - Acknowledge any constraints or uncertainties in the study.

6. **Citation and References**:
   - Cite references in the text using LaTeX commands. For example, if citing a paper in .bib format (e.g., `@article{warner1991,...}`), it should appear in the text as \cite{warner1991}
   - Provide references in `.bib` format in a separate section.

7. **JOURNAL PAPER WRITING STYLE**:
   - **NO bullet points in conclusions** - Write 2-3 flowing paragraphs
   - Transform all lists into connected narrative prose
   - Use transitional phrases like "Furthermore," "In addition," "Moreover"
   - See `prompts/prompts_writing_style_journal` for narrative flow guidance

### LaTeX Code Structure:
- Write the conclusion as a cohesive narrative, adhering to academic standards and using LaTeX formatting.
- Include proper citations for all referenced literature.

### Example Output:
```latex
\section{Conclusions}
The findings of this study underscore the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing [specific problem]. Our analysis revealed that [key result], achieving a performance improvement of [numerical value] compared to baseline methods. The proposed model's robustness was further validated through [validation method], with metrics such as [metric, e.g., accuracy, precision] reaching [value].

This study introduced several innovative features, including [key feature 1] and [key feature 2], which were pivotal in achieving [outcome]. The model demonstrated versatility in [specific applications], highlighting its potential to be adapted for [other scenarios].

Comparisons with the existing literature reveal [summary of comparison]. For instance, while prior studies such as \cite{warner1991} achieved [result], our findings surpass these benchmarks by [specific metric]. This demonstrates the significant advancements made by our approach in [domain].

The applications of our model extend beyond [current case] to potential use cases such as [application 1] and [application 2]. Future research could explore [suggested extensions].

(Note: the above prompts may generate ingenuine references.)
### Special Request:
- Do not include document class, package inclusions. Just focus on the table itself. For example, you should not include `\documentclass{...}`, `\begin{documnet}`, `\usepackage{...}`, or `\end{document}`.
