## Integrated Results, Tables & Figures Analysis + Discussion Prompt Library

### 1‚ÄÉAfter You Finish Typesetting All Tables and Figures  
Analyze and compare the results **critically** before drafting the Discussion:

| Comparison Approach | Purpose | Typical Questions to Ask |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------|
| **Horizontal** (contrast with prior research) | Situate findings within the field | ‚Ä¢ How do our results align or differ from Author (Year)?<br>‚Ä¢ Do they confirm, extend, or contradict existing theories?<br>‚Ä¢ **How do they validate our breakthrough approach?** |
| **Vertical** (in-depth internal analysis) | Probe nuances inside your dataset | ‚Ä¢ Are patterns consistent across sub-groups, time points, or experimental conditions?<br>‚Ä¢ Do any anomalies emerge that merit explanation?<br>‚Ä¢ **Do results show the expected improvements from our innovation?** |
| **Innovation Validation** *(NEW)* | Demonstrate breakthrough effectiveness | ‚Ä¢ Does our approach address the gaps identified in research_gaps_analysis.md?<br>‚Ä¢ Are improvements quantitatively superior (15-30%)?<br>‚Ä¢ Which specific limitations of prior work are overcome? |

#### Scenarios to Address
1. **Consistent with prior research** ‚Üí Explain **why** this agreement matters for theory or practice.  
2. **Divergent without explanation** ‚Üí Acknowledge **uncertainties** and propose plausible hypotheses.  
3. **Divergent with explanation** ‚Üí Analyze **underlying causes** (e.g., methodological innovations, sample differences).
4. **Breakthrough validation** *(NEW)* ‚Üí Show how your results **overcome specific limitations** identified in gap analysis.
5. **Performance improvement** *(NEW)* ‚Üí Quantify gains and explain **why your innovation works better**.

> **Special Request**‚ÄÉFocus *only* on the content of tables/figures; **omit** any LaTeX boiler-plate such as `\documentclass`, `\usepackage`, `\begin{document}`, or `\end{document}`.

### 2‚ÄÉResults & Discussions Section Prompt Library  
Use the boldface starter phrases and ‚ü®angle-bracket placeholders‚ü© to draft each logical element. Mix-and-match, ensuring every Discussion claim is traceable to the Results above.

#### 2.1‚ÄÉSummarise the Core Findings
1. **‚ÄúFrom the above discussion, the conclusion can be reached that ‚ü®concise overarching conclusion‚ü©.‚Äù**  
2. **‚ÄúCollectively, the results demonstrate that ‚ü®key insight 1‚ü©, ‚ü®key insight 2‚ü©, and ‚ü®key insight 3‚ü©.‚Äù**  
3. **‚ÄúAlthough the present work focuses on ‚ü®scope‚ü©, the findings clearly indicate ‚ü®broader implication‚ü©.‚Äù**

#### 2.2‚ÄÉRelate to Existing Literature
1. **‚ÄúWhen comparing our results to those of ‚ü®Author, Year‚ü©, it must be pointed out that ‚ü®similarity/difference‚ü©.‚Äù**  
2. **‚ÄúThese basic observations are consistent with research showing that ‚ü®previous finding‚ü©.‚Äù**  
3. **‚ÄúOne departure from earlier studies, however, is that ‚ü®your novel aspect‚ü©.‚Äù**

#### 2.3‚ÄÉTheoretical, Methodological, or Practical Contributions
1. **‚ÄúThis paper has presented a theoretical and experimental study of the ‚ü®process‚ü© and introduces a ‚ü®method/theory‚ü©.‚Äù**  
2. **‚ÄúIn general, ‚ü®YYY theory‚ü© provides an alternative foundation for ‚ü®XXX analysis‚ü© in ‚ü®context‚ü©.‚Äù**  
3. **‚ÄúThe scope of this contribution is to advance ‚ü®field/method‚ü© by ‚ü®specific innovation‚ü©.‚Äù**

#### 2.4‚ÄÉValue and Limitations
1. **‚ÄúNotwithstanding its limitations, this study suggests ‚ü®practical value‚ü©.‚Äù**  
2. **‚ÄúUnfortunately, we cannot determine ‚ü®parameter‚ü© from the available data; our results lack ‚ü®limitation‚ü©.‚Äù**  
3. **‚ÄúOne limitation of these methods, however, is that they ‚ü®method restriction‚ü©.‚Äù**  
4. **‚ÄúDespite its preliminary character, this study clearly indicates ‚ü®early but solid takeaway‚ü©.‚Äù**

#### 2.5‚ÄÉFuture Directions & Recommendations
1. **‚ÄúOne important future direction of this work is ‚ü®future study‚ü©.‚Äù**  
2. **‚ÄúThus, future iterations of ‚ü®technique/model‚ü© may demonstrate even greater potency.‚Äù**  
3. **‚ÄúThe experimental results should serve as useful feedback for improving ‚ü®application/field‚ü©.‚Äù**

#### 2.6‚ÄÉUnanswered Questions & Next Steps
1. **‚ÄúThere remain three aspects that require further investigation: (1) ‚ü®open question 1‚ü©, (2) ‚ü®open question 2‚ü©, and (3) ‚ü®open question 3‚ü©.‚Äù**  
2. **‚ÄúAddressing these gaps will entail ‚ü®proposed method or experiment‚ü©.‚Äù**

### 3‚ÄÉWriting Tips (Quick Checklist)
* **Depth vs. Breadth** ‚Äî drill into unique or surprising findings.  
* **Balance Strengths & Weaknesses** ‚Äî acknowledge limitations honestly; avoid over-claiming.  
* **Logical Flow** ‚Äî progress from summary ‚Üí comparison ‚Üí contribution ‚Üí limitation ‚Üí future work.  
* **Consistency with Results** ‚Äî keep every statement anchored to data or figures.  
* **Clarity & Conciseness** ‚Äî one key idea per paragraph; avoid repeating Results verbatim.
* **FOR JOURNAL PAPERS**: Use narrative prose instead of bullet lists
  - Transform result lists into connected paragraphs
  - Use transitional phrases between findings
  - See `prompts/prompts_writing_style_journal` for guidance
