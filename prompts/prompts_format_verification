# Format Verification Checklist

## Format Verification Before Section PDF Compilation

Before compiling any section PDF, verify:

### 1. Template Type Detection
Determine which type of paper you're working on:
- **Competition**: Check if problem/ contains competition PDF (MCM/ICM/HiMCM/IMMC)
- **Journal**: Check for Elsevier/Springer/ASCE/AMCS document class

### 2. Introduction Section Rules
Apply the correct format based on template type:
- **IF competition THEN subsections required**
  - Must include: \subsection{Problem Background and Overview}
  - Must include: \subsection{Literature Review}
  - Must include: \subsection{Critics on Previous Works}
  - Must include: \subsection{Restatement of the Problem}
  - Must include: \subsection{Statement of Purpose and Our Strategy on the Problem}
  
- **IF journal THEN subsections forbidden**
  - NO \subsection{} commands allowed
  - Write as continuous narrative paragraphs
  - Flow naturally from topic to topic

### 3. Automatic Format Check
```python
def verify_introduction_format(template_type):
    intro_content = open('introduction.tex').read()
    has_subsections = '\\subsection{' in intro_content
    
    if template_type == 'journal' and has_subsections:
        raise FormatError("❌ Journal papers must NOT have subsections in Introduction!")
    elif template_type == 'competition' and not has_subsections:
        raise FormatError("❌ Competition papers MUST have subsections in Introduction!")
```

### 4. Other Section Format Rules
- **Methods**: Both competition and journal papers can have subsections
- **Results**: Both competition and journal papers can have subsections
- **Conclusions**: Usually no subsections for either type
- **Summary/Abstract**: Never has subsections

### 5. Visual Verification Guide

**Competition Introduction - CORRECT**:
```latex
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Background and Overview}
The rapid growth of urban populations...

\subsection{Literature Review}
Recent studies have shown...
```

**Journal Introduction - CORRECT**:
```latex
\section{Introduction}
The rapid growth of urban populations has created unprecedented challenges for traffic management. Recent studies have shown that traditional approaches...
```

**Journal Introduction - WRONG**:
```latex
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background} % ❌ NO SUBSECTIONS IN JOURNAL INTRO!
The rapid growth...
```

### 6. Format Verification Checklist

Before proceeding with PDF compilation:
- [ ] Template type correctly identified (competition/journal)
- [ ] Introduction format matches template requirements
- [ ] Subsection usage verified for current section
- [ ] No format mixing between templates
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout document

### 7. Kill Switch Provisions

**STOP immediately if**:
- Journal introduction contains ANY \subsection{} commands
- Competition introduction lacks required subsections
- Template type cannot be determined
- Mixed formatting detected (journal style with competition subsections)

When kill switch triggered:
1. Display clear error message
2. Show correct format example
3. Request user clarification on template type
4. Do not proceed until format is corrected
