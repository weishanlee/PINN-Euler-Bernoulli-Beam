# General Instructions and Rules for Paper Generation

## Project Overview
This system generates AI-assisted academic papers for:
- Mathematical modeling competitions (MCM/ICM, HiMCM, IMMC)
- Peer-reviewed journals (Elsevier, ASCE, Springer, etc.)

## Core Principles

### 1. No Hallucination Policy
- **CRITICAL**: Every paper or dataset MUST be fetched live from the Internet
- Never cite papers from memory or pre-training
- Always verify sources with HTTP 200 responses
- Store only successfully downloaded files

### 2. File Management Rules
- **ALWAYS** edit existing files rather than creating new ones
- **NEVER** create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Copy templates rather than creating from scratch
- Use `\input{}` in main.tex rather than inline content

### 3. Folder Organization

**Input Folders** (User-Provided):
- `problem/` - Competition problems or research outlines (PDF)
- `data/` - Optional user data files
- `figures/` - Optional user figures
- `codes/` - Optional user implementations
- `papers/` - Optional user research papers

**Output Folders** (Generated):
- `output/*.tex` - Generated LaTeX sections
- `output/main.tex` - Main LaTeX document
- `output/ref.bib` - Bibliography file
- `output/main.pdf` - Final compiled PDF
- `output/papers/` - Web-scraped research papers
- `output/data/` - Generated data tables (CSV)
- `output/figures/` - Generated visualizations (PNG)
- `output/codes/` - Implementation scripts (Python)
- `utilityScripts/` - Helper scripts not directly related to current project

### 4. Citation Requirements
- **Competitions**: Always use IEEE numeric style `[1], [2], [3]`
- **Journals**: Use journal-specific style (check template)
- Never override template citation styles

### 5. Research Paper Requirements
- Minimum 50 arXiv papers
- Minimum 30 peer-reviewed journal papers
- Maximum 20% from same journal
- Store all PDFs with proper documentation
- Generate consolidated ref.bib file

### 6. Language Restrictions
Avoid these words to prevent AI detection:
- Innovative, Meticulous, Intricate, Notable, Versatile
- Noteworthy, Invaluable, Pivotal, Potent, Fresh
- Ingenious, Meticulously, Reportedly, Lucidly
- Innovatively, Aptly, Methodically, Excellently
- Compellingly, Impressively, Undoubtedly, Scholarly, Strategically

### 7. LaTeX Best Practices
- Always check template requirements first
- Use proper figure/table referencing (`\ref{fig:}`, `\ref{tab:}`)
- Include captions for all figures and tables
- Compile with: pdflatex → biber → pdflatex → pdflatex

### 8. Python Environment Usage
- Web scraping: `~/.venv/webScraping/bin/python`
- ML/Analysis: `~/.venv/ml_31123121/bin/python`
- Always use appropriate environment for task

### 9. Quality Assurance
- Verify all citations resolve to real papers
- Check LaTeX compilation logs for errors
- Ensure figures use consistent color schemes
- Validate data processing results

### 10. Special Instructions
- For competitions: Never include author information
- For journals: Include author/affiliation as specified
- Always integrate user-provided materials appropriately
- Document AI usage transparently in appendix

## Minimal Intervention Principle

**GOLDEN RULE**: Do exactly what is asked - no more, no less.

### Examples:
- Asked: "Typeset methods section"
  - ✓ Do: Compile methods.tex with minimal wrapper
  - ❌ Don't: Add abstract, authors, keywords

- Asked: "Make introduction like main.pdf"
  - ✓ Do: Ask "Do you mean the formatting/fonts or the full structure?"
  - ❌ Don't: Assume and copy everything

### When Adding Elements
Only add document elements when:
1. Explicitly requested by user
2. Required for technical reasons (explain why)
3. After getting clarification

Never add "because it looks more complete" or "for consistency".
