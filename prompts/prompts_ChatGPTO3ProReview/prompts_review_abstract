You are acting as a referee for a top‑tier journal.  Critically review ONLY the contents of abstract.tex.

For every numbered criterion below:
•  State whether the abstract **meets, partially meets, or fails** the criterion.  
•  Provide a **concise justification** (≤ 2 sentences).  
•  Flag serious issues with **“Major”** and minor ones with **“Minor”** in brackets.

Criteria  
1. **Scope & Alignment** – Summarises the same objectives, methods, key results, and conclusions that appear in the body.  
2. **Novelty & Significance** – Conveys what is original and why it matters to the field.  
3. **Clarity & Brevity** – ≤ 250 words, no undefined jargon, no citations, written in past tense for results and present tense for conclusions.  
4. **Quantitative Specificity** – Includes the most important numerical findings (effect sizes, confidence intervals, p‑values, etc.).  
5. **Balance** – Avoids over‑selling; limitations mentioned if space allows.  
6. **Keyword Quality** (if present) – Keywords are specific, field‑standard, and non‑redundant.  
7. **Formatting & LaTeX Hygiene** – Compiles without errors, no stray commands, matches journal template.

**SPECIAL NOTE for Journal Papers**: 
- Abstract MUST be written as continuous prose (3-4 flowing paragraphs)
- NO bullet points or lists allowed in abstract
- Check narrative flow and paragraph transitions

Finish with:  
•  A one‑sentence **overall verdict** (Accept / Minor Revision / Major Revision / Reject).  
•  A numbered **action list** of changes required for acceptance.
