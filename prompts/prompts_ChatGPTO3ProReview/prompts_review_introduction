Review ONLY introduction.tex under the following rules.  Structure feedback as:

A. Strengths (bullet list)  
B. Weaknesses & Required Revisions (bullet list labelled Major / Minor)  
C. Recommendation: Accept / Minor Rev / Major Rev / Reject for this section

Evaluation Criteria  
1. **Context & Motivation** – Clearly explains the problem's importance with up‑to‑date, balanced literature review.  
2. **Gap Identification** – Pinpoints exactly what is unknown or contested.  
3. **Objective Statement** – Ends with a precise statement of aims/hypotheses matching the abstract and methods.  
4. **Logical Flow** – Paragraph ordering leads the reader seamlessly from broad context to specific purpose.  
5. **Citation Practice** – High‑quality, peer‑reviewed sources; no excessive self‑citation; correct BibTeX keys.  
6. **Citation Balance** – Alternates between author-prominent (e.g., "Chen et al. [1] demonstrate...") and information-prominent (e.g., "Recent advances show... [2-4]") styles; NEVER uses dangling citations like "[5] demonstrates...".  
7. **Original Contribution Claim** – Claims are proportional to evidence and not duplicated elsewhere.  
8. **Language & Style** – Formal scientific tone, active voice where appropriate, free of grammatical errors.
   - **For journal papers**: Should use narrative prose, not bullet-heavy lists
   - **Check for**: Smooth paragraph transitions and connected flow
9. **LaTeX & Formatting** – Sectioning commands comply with journal class; no over‑full hboxes; hyperlinks compile.
   - **For journal papers**: NO subsections allowed in introduction
