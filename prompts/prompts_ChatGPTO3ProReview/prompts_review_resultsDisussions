You are reviewing the combined Results & Discussion section.  Provide:

1. **Section‑by‑Section Commentary** – Align each major result with its discussion paragraph.  
2. **Integrated Assessment** – 3–5 sentences on overall validity and interpretation quality.  
3. **Action Items** – Ordered list (Major first).

Critique Dimensions  
• **Data Presentation** – Tables/figures are self‑contained, labelled, referenced in text, and statistical significance indicated.  
• **Consistency with Methods** – No analyses introduced post‑hoc; all stated methods are represented.  
• **Interpretation vs. Speculation** – Conclusions drawn directly from data, speculation clearly sign‑posted.  
• **Comparative Context** – Results compared fairly with prior studies; contradictions addressed.  
• **Limitations Discussion** – Discusses weaknesses, generalisability, and potential biases.  
• **Graphics & Captions** – Resolution ≥300 dpi, colour‑blind‑safe, captions explain abbreviations and test statistics.  
• **Numerical Integrity** – Report exact p‑values, confidence intervals, effect sizes; rounding consistent.  
• **LaTeX Etiquette** – Uses `\label`/`\ref`, proper `subfigure` or `subcaption`, no manual line breaks in math.
• **Citation Balance** – When comparing results with literature, uses both author-prominent (e.g., "Our findings contrast with Johnson et al. [1]...") and information-prominent citations; no dangling references.

End with a one‑sentence **impact statement**: “These results, if robust, advance the field by …”.
