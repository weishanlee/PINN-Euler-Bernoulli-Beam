# Review Checkpoint Guidelines

## Overview
This document defines the review checkpoints for each section in the incremental PDF compilation workflow. At each checkpoint, the AI must STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding.

## General Review Protocol

### STOP Message Format
```

Please review the PDF and check the following items.
Then respond with:

```

## Section-Specific Checklists

### IMPORTANT: Section Checklist in PDF
**Each section PDF will include a comprehensive checklist at the end. This checklist will appear both as LaTeX comments in the .tex file AND as a visible section in the PDF for easy review.**

**NOTE FOR FINAL ASSEMBLY**: These checklists are for individual section review only. When compiling the final main.pdf, these checklist sections will NOT be included - only the actual content of each section is used in main.tex.

### How Checklists Are Excluded from Final PDF

**IMPORTANT**: The checklists must remain in the original section .tex files for review PDFs. For the final main.pdf, use ONE of these methods:

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Reference Verification Summary sections that appear in review checklists (especially in introduction sections) MUST also be excluded from the final main.pdf. These summaries are ONLY for review purposes to help users verify downloaded papers.

1. **Method A - Clean Files**: Create clean versions without checklists
   ```bash
   # Example: Create introduction_clean.tex from introduction.tex
   # Copy content up to (but not including) the checklist section
   ```

2. **Method B - Marker Comments**: Add a special marker before checklists
   ```latex
   %% BEGIN REVIEW CHECKLIST - DO NOT INCLUDE IN FINAL PDF
   \newpage
   \section*{========== SECTION REVIEW CHECKLIST ==========}
   [checklist content...]
   %% END REVIEW CHECKLIST
   ```
   Then in main.tex, use custom input commands that stop at the marker.

3. **Method C - Manual Extraction**: When creating main.tex, manually extract only the content portions, excluding everything after the checklist marker.

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT delete checklists from the original .tex files!

### 1. Introduction Section Review

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Problem statement is accurately captured
- [ ] Literature review covers relevant papers
- [ ] All citations have corresponding PDFs in output/papers/
- [ ] Research gap is clearly identified
- [ ] Proposed approach is well motivated
- [ ] Writing flows logically
- [ ] No grammatical errors or typos

**Specific Questions:**
1. Does the introduction adequately motivate why this problem is important?
2. Are there any key papers or methods that should be added to the literature review?
3. Is the research gap clearly articulated?
4. Does the proposed approach align with what you want to implement?

**What to Look For:**
- Verify all 5 Ps are covered (for competitions)
- Check that cited papers actually exist
- Ensure no hallucinated references
- Confirm problem restatement matches original

**Automated Verification Summary:**
The introduction PDF will include an automated verification summary showing:
- Total papers attempted and verified
- Verification success rate (should be >95%)
- Number of papers automatically excluded
- All verification decisions were made automatically
- Full details available in output/verification_db.json

**Example Checklist in LaTeX (added to .tex file):**
```latex
% At the end of introduction.tex, AFTER all main content:

## Handling Revisions

### Revision Response Format
When user requests revisions, acknowledge with:
```
📝 Revision Request Received
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Section: [Section Name]
Current Version: v[n]
Next Version: v[n+1]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Changes requested:
1. [Change 1]
2. [Change 2]
...

Working on revisions...
```

### Post-Revision
After making changes:
1. Create new version (v2, v3, etc.)
2. Log changes in version_log.txt
3. Recompile PDF
4. Present same review checkpoint again

## Quality Metrics

Track these metrics across sections:
- Number of revisions per section
- Common revision themes
- Compilation success rate
- Time spent per section

## Special Considerations

### Large Sections
For sections that might exceed 10 pages:
- Warn user about length
- Offer to split if appropriate
- Ensure PDF is still manageable

### Dependencies
Some sections depend on others:
- Results depends on code execution
- Conclusions depends on results
- Flag any forward references

### Template Compliance

## Section-by-Section Double-Checks

After completing each section, perform these comprehensive checks:

### 1. Post-Introduction Check
- ✓ All citations have verified PDFs
- ✓ Problem correctly restated
- ✓ Literature review matches downloaded papers
- ✓ **CRITICAL: Every sentence is supported by specific literature source or evidence**
- ✓ Document which LaTeX packages this section's content requires
- ✓ Reference Verification Summary included (for review PDF only)

### 2. Post-Methods Check
- ✓ All equations properly formatted
- ✓ Code in output/codes/ passes test mode
- ✓ **CRITICAL: If code contains model training, STOP and handoff to user**
- ✓ **CRITICAL: Run validation_checklist.py before handoff**
- ✓ **CRITICAL: Generate execution_plan.json with dependencies**
- ✓ **CRITICAL: Create EXECUTION_INSTRUCTIONS.md for user**
- ✓ Pseudo-code matches implementation
- ✓ **CRITICAL: Every claim is backed by mathematical derivation or cited source**
- ✓ **CRITICAL: Code implementation MUST reflect actual methods described in tex file**
- ✓ **CRITICAL: No mismatch between mathematical formulas and code algorithms**
- ✓ Document which LaTeX packages this section's content requires
- ✓ Verify these packages will be available in final compilation

### 3. Post-Results Check
- ✓ All figures exist in output/figures/
- ✓ All figures with boxes passed validation (no overlaps)
- ✓ All tables have source data in output/data/
- ✓ Results are reproducible from provided code
- ✓ Box validation reports saved for all diagrams
- ✓ **CRITICAL: Every result is traceable to actual computational output**
- ✓ Document which LaTeX packages this section's content requires
- ✓ Verify these packages will be available in final compilation

### 4. Post-Conclusions Check
- ✓ Conclusions follow logically from results
- ✓ No new claims introduced without support
- ✓ Future work is feasible and relevant
- ✓ All recommendations are evidence-based

### 5. Post-Summary/Abstract Check
- ✓ Word count within limits
- ✓ Key contributions clearly stated
- ✓ Results accurately summarized
- ✓ No claims beyond what's in the paper
Always verify:
- Section follows template style
- Citations use correct format
- Formatting matches competition/journal requirements

## Emergency Procedures

### If Compilation Fails
1. Show detailed error message
2. Attempt automatic fix
3. If still failing, create plain text version for review
4. Ask user for guidance

### If User is Unresponsive
After presenting checkpoint:
1. Wait indefinitely (do not timeout)
2. Do NOT proceed without approval
3. User may return hours/days later

## Review Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Point out exact issues
2. **Be Constructive**: Suggest improvements
3. **Be Thorough**: Check all aspects
4. **Be Patient**: Allow time for careful review
5. **Be Clear**: Make approval process obvious
