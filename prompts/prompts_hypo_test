Prompts for Understanding Statistical Hypothesis Testing Methods:
 
Act as an expert in statistics and machine learning. Read data/ or output/data to analyze data related files to provide clear, detailed, and structured explanations for each of the following questions. Use intuitive examples, mathematical insights, and real-world applications to enhance understanding. Where applicable, compare methods, highlight assumptions, and discuss practical implications.
    1. Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing:
        ◦ Explain the concept of hypothesis testing in statistics and machine learning.
        ◦ Why is it important? What types of problems does it help solve?
        ◦ Discuss key concepts such as null and alternative hypotheses, significance levels, and Type I & Type II errors.
    2. Z-Test:
        ◦ How does the Z-test work? Explain its mathematical foundation.
        ◦ When is it appropriate to use a Z-test? What assumptions must be met?
        ◦ Discuss its limitations and situations where other tests might be preferable.
    3. Z-Test vs. T-Test:
        ◦ What are the key differences between a Z-test and a t-test?
        ◦ In what scenarios would you choose one over the other?
        ◦ Provide an example illustrating the decision-making process.
    4. Chi-Square Test:
        ◦ Explain the purpose and mechanics of the Chi-Square test.
        ◦ Provide a real-world example where it is used (e.g., categorical data analysis, independence testing).
        ◦ What assumptions should be met for the test to be valid?
    5. ANOVA vs. T-Test:
        ◦ How does ANOVA differ from a simple t-test?
        ◦ What additional insights does it provide when analyzing multiple groups?
        ◦ Give an example where ANOVA is the preferred choice.
    6. Non-Parametric Tests (Mann-Whitney U Test):
        ◦ When should non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test be used instead of parametric tests?
        ◦ What assumptions do they avoid, and why might that be beneficial?
        ◦ Provide a case study demonstrating its use.
    7. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:
        ◦ How do I interpret the results of a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test?
        ◦ What does the test statistic and p-value indicate?
        ◦ How does this test compare to other normality or goodness-of-fit tests?
    8. Shapiro-Wilk Test & Visualization Methods:
        ◦ Explain how the Shapiro-Wilk test determines if data follows a normal distribution.
        ◦ What are its advantages and limitations?
        ◦ How do visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, Q-Q plots) complement this test?
    9. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (Paired Samples):
        ◦ What is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and how does it compare paired samples?
        ◦ When would this test be useful? Provide a real-world example.
        ◦ How does it compare to the paired t-test in terms of assumptions and applicability?
    10. Bayesian vs. Frequentist Hypothesis Testing:
        ◦ How does Bayesian hypothesis testing differ from traditional frequentist methods?
        ◦ What are the key advantages and trade-offs of the Bayesian approach?
        ◦ Provide an example of when Bayesian testing might be preferred over frequentist testing.
Formatting and Additional Enhancements:
    • Use step-by-step explanations, examples, and comparisons where necessary.
    • Provide simple mathematical formulations when helpful, but focus on conceptual clarity.
    • Use practical applications to illustrate each method's importance.
