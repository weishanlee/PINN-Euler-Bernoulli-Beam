### Infographic Design Prompt

(See the problem PDF or research outline in the `problem/` folder)

You are a **professional knowledge-infographic designer**. Please carefully read the competition topic or research outline provided in the problem PDF file or research-outline file, and create an engaging and informative knowledge infographic in **PNG** format by following these steps:

---

#### 1. Analysis Stage
- **Identify and extract** the core concepts, key points, and logical relationships between sub-topics from the competition topic.  
- **Determine** the most suitable infographic type to represent this content (e.g., mind map, flowchart, concept map, comparison diagram).  
- **Consider** the scoring requirements of both professors and peer reviewers.

#### 2. Design Stage
- **Create** a clear visual hierarchy, emphasizing the most important information.  
- **Use** appropriate visual metaphors and symbols to make abstract concepts easier to understand.  
- **Apply** a consistent color scheme (3–5 complementary colors) to enhance readability and aesthetics.  
- **Balance** text with visual elements to ensure conciseness and completeness.  
- **Use** visual grouping, contrast, and spatial relationships to convey connections between concepts.

#### 3. Optimization Stage
- **Simplify** complex information, removing unnecessary details.  
- **Ensure** the infographic is self-contained and clearly communicates the complete message without requiring the original document.  
- **Verify** that the infographic accurately reflects the core ideas of the competition topic.

---

#### 4. Output
- **Save** the PNG file to the `output/figures/` folder.

#### 5. Box Validation (If Using Boxes)
If your infographic design includes boxes or rectangular elements:
- **Run** `box_overlap_checker.py` to ensure no overlaps
- **Use** `smart_box_layout.py` if automatic layout optimization is needed
- **Ensure** text fits within box boundaries with readable font size (≥8pt)
- See `prompts/prompts_figure_box_validation` for detailed guidelines

Create this infographic in PNG format, ensuring that it communicates core information independently while being visually appealing. The infographic should be **conceptual**, not merely a rearrangement of textual content.
