# AI Usage Report (appendixAIReport.tex)

## üìé CRITICAL DISTINCTION: AI Report vs General Appendix

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS NOT A GENERAL APPENDIX!** This prompt is specifically for the AI Usage Report appendix.

### Two Different Types of Appendices:

1. **AI Report Appendix (THIS FILE - `appendixAIReport.tex`)**
   - **Purpose**: MANDATORY disclosure of AI tool usage for ethics/compliance
   - **Required by**: Competition rules or journal ethics policies
   - **Content**: Lists of AI tools, specific queries, how AI was used
   - **Example**: "We used Claude Code Opus 4 for generating initial code templates..."
   - **Status**: MANDATORY - Must be included for submission acceptance

2. **General Appendix (DIFFERENT FILE - `appendix.tex`)**
   - **Purpose**: OPTIONAL supplementary technical material
   - **Content**: Extra results, extended proofs, additional figures/tables
   - **Example**: "Extended sensitivity analysis showing parameter variations..."
   - **Status**: OPTIONAL - Only if you have overflow content
   - **See**: `prompts/prompts_appendix` for general appendix instructions

**DO NOT MIX THESE UP!** If you need to add extra experimental results or supplementary figures, use the general appendix (`appendix.tex`), NOT this AI report.

## Instructions for AI Usage Report

Note: Prompt1 is for Mathematical Modeling Competition Project and Prompt2 is for peer-reviewed journal papers.

<Prompt1:>
You are an expert mathematical modeling competitor. Based on the provided .tex files in the subfolder output/ and the problem statement in the problem/ subfolder, and as per requested by the competition instructions on the Report on Use of AI, write, in LaTeX format, at least 50 possible queries related to the contest problem and the corresponding outputs for each query. These queries should reflect the use of AI tools, such as OpenAI ChatGPT, Claude Code Opus 4, to inspire our solution, while ensuring that the outputs are not directly implemented in their exact form. The outputs should serve as a foundation for inspiration, and our actual implementation will deviate from the provided outputs to ensure originality in our solutions.

### Initial Paragraph (You should paraphrase the following initial paragraph. However, the expression `... are the EXACT queries‚Ä¶` MUST be kept.):
We utilized Claude Code Opus (claude-opus-4-20250514) and MCPs of PlayWright and Context7 during the development of our solutions to the current pdf problems. Below are the EXACT queries we posed and the corresponding outputs provided by the AI tool. These responses inspired our work but were not directly implemented in their exact form to maintain compliance with competition guidelines.

### LaTeX Format:
```latex
\begin{enumerate}[\textbf{Query\arabic{enumi}:}]
    \item What are the key considerations when designing a mathematical model for evaluating environmental impacts of high-performance computing systems?
    \item[\textbf{Output1:}] Key considerations include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identifying relevant environmental metrics (e.g., energy consumption, carbon emissions, resource utilization).
        \item Defining a framework to quantify and compare these metrics across systems.
        \item Incorporating temporal and spatial variability in the metrics where applicable.
        \item Using scalable and adaptable methods to accommodate diverse systems and datasets.
    \end{itemize}

    \item How can we use sensitivity analysis to improve model robustness?
    \item[\textbf{Output2:}] Sensitivity analysis techniques include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Variance-based sensitivity analysis to determine how input uncertainties affect outputs.
        \item Local sensitivity analysis by perturbing one variable at a time.
        \item Global sensitivity analysis to capture interactions between multiple variables.
    \end{itemize}

    \item What statistical methods can help validate our model's accuracy?
    \item[\textbf{Output3:}] Useful statistical methods include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for quantitative predictions.
        \item R-squared to measure the goodness-of-fit for regression models.
        \item Cross-validation techniques to test model generalizability.
    \end{itemize}

    \item How can we incorporate trade-offs into multi-criteria decision-making models?
    \item[\textbf{Output4:}] To handle trade-offs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use weighted scoring systems with normalized criteria values.
        \item Apply Pareto front analysis to identify non-dominated solutions.
        \item Employ Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to derive weights based on expert preferences.
    \end{itemize}

    \item What are the best ways to visualize multi-dimensional data for decision-making?
    \item[\textbf{Output5:}] Effective visualizations include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Radar charts to compare multiple criteria for a single entity.
        \item Parallel coordinate plots to show relationships across multiple dimensions.
        \item Heatmaps to highlight patterns or outliers in large datasets.
    \end{itemize}

    \item How can we simplify complex models for better interpretability?
    \item[\textbf{Output6:}] Simplification methods include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
        \item Rule-based models for interpretable decision boundaries.
        \item Regularization techniques (e.g., LASSO) to reduce the number of variables.
    \end{itemize}

    % Add more queries and corresponding outputs.

\end{enumerate}

### Special Request:
- Do not include document class, package inclusions. Just focus on the table itself. For example, you should not include `\documentclass{...}`, `\begin{documnet}`, `\usepackage{...}`, or `\end{document}`.
