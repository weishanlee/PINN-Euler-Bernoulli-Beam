Prompt for describing Table: 
You are an expert in academic writing. Your task is to write tables in LaTeX code and provide a detailed explanation for each table in LaTeX format. Follow these instructions:

### Table Requirements:
1. **Table Creation**:
   - Use LaTeX to create well-structured and professional tables.
   - Ensure tables are appropriately formatted for academic use, including headers, units (if applicable), and clear organization.

2. **Table Explanation**:
   - For each table, write at least 150 words explaining the key features and insights it conveys.
   - Highlight how the table contributes to understanding the data or results, focusing on its relevance to the research objectives.
   - The explanation should provide sufficient context for the reader to interpret the table effectively.

3. **Citing Tables**:
   - Cite each table in the text using LaTeX commands, such as `\ref{tab:<label>}`,. Use clear and proper referencing for tables in the explanations.
   - Use the following format for inserting tables:

```latex
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{<Insert a descriptive and concise caption summarizing the table's content and purpose>}
    \label{tab:<label>}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} \\ \hline
    Value 1           & Value 2           & Value 3           \\ \hline
    Value 4           & Value 5           & Value 6           \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Special Request:
- Do not include document class, package inclusions. Just focus on the table itself. For example, you should not include `\documentclass{...}`, `\begin{documnet}`, `\usepackage{...}`, or `\end{document}`.
