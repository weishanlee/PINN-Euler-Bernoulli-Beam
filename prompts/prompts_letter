### Writing a Letter (ONLY for Projects Related to Mathematical Modeling Competitions)

**Prompt**  
You are an expert mathematical-modeling competitor. Using the compiled `.tex` files in the `output/` subfolder and the problem statement found in the `problem/` subfolder, write a formal letter in **LaTeX code** format.

**Special Requests**  
- **No boilerplate**: Omit `\documentclass{…}`, `\begin{document}`, `\usepackage{…}`, `\end{document}`, and any package setups. Supply **only** the letter body.  
- **Length**: The letter must occupy **one or two full A4 pages**, as dictated by the problem PDF.  
- **Line spacing**: Apply `\spacing{1.1}` (or an equivalent command) to ensure adequate page coverage.  
- **Bullet points**: Present key findings and recommendations as concise bullet lists.  
- **Quantitative results**: Embed concrete numerical outputs from your model (e.g., optimal values, error metrics, sensitivity coefficients).  
- **Practical implications**: Expand on management strategies and real-world actions derived from the modeling outcomes.
