## CRITICAL: Balanced Citation Approach

**MANDATORY**: You MUST use BOTH author-prominent and information-prominent citation methods throughout your paper. Alternate between these methods to create natural, varied academic writing.

## 1. Author-Prominent Citations

Use author-prominent citations when:
- Evaluating or critiquing scholars' work
- Comparing different approaches or methodologies
- Showing disciplinary lineage or theoretical evolution
- Employing reporting verbs that signal your stance
- Emphasizing WHO made the contribution

### Examples of Author-Prominent Citations

**Good Examples**:
```latex
% Evaluating work
Smith and Johnson [1] demonstrate that deep learning models can achieve 95% accuracy on complex image classification tasks, though their approach requires substantial computational resources.

% Comparing scholars
While Chen et al. [2] advocate for ensemble methods, Williams and Davis [3] argue that single models with proper regularization achieve comparable performance.

% Showing lineage
Building on the foundational work of Thompson [4], recent studies by Martinez and Lee [5] extend the framework to multi-modal scenarios.

% Using reporting verbs
Kumar et al. [6] propose a novel architecture that...
Anderson and Brown [7] challenge the assumption that...
Zhang [8] reveals significant limitations in...
```

**Bad Examples**:
```latex
% NEVER write dangling citations
[9] demonstrates that...  % WRONG - no author name
[10] argues that...       % WRONG - no author name

% Always include author names with author-prominent style
The approach in [11] shows...  % WRONG - should be "Wang et al. [11] show..."
```

## 2. Information-Prominent Citations

Use information-prominent citations when:
- Presenting established facts or background information
- Citing multiple sources for the same claim
- Prioritizing the information over the source
- Maintaining word count economy
- Creating smoother narrative flow

### Examples of Information-Prominent Citations

**Good Examples**:
```latex
% Established background
Neural networks have revolutionized computer vision tasks over the past decade [12-15].

% Multiple supporting sources
Recent advances in transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results across various NLP benchmarks [16-19].

% Factual statements
The human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs [20].

% Technical specifications
The algorithm achieves O(n log n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity [21].
```

## 3. Balanced Citation Patterns

### Example Paragraph with Mixed Citations

```latex
\subsection{Related Work}

% Information-prominent opening
Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex sequential decision problems [22-24]. 

% Author-prominent for specific contribution
Mnih et al. [25] pioneered the application of deep Q-networks to Atari games, demonstrating superhuman performance across multiple titles. 

% Information-prominent for general trend
Subsequent work has extended these methods to continuous control tasks [26-28]. 

% Author-prominent for comparison
While Silver et al. [29] focus on model-based approaches for board games, Schulman et al. [30] develop policy gradient methods better suited for robotics applications.

% Information-prominent conclusion
These advances have enabled practical applications in autonomous driving, robotics manipulation, and resource management [31-33].

## 4. Section-Specific Guidelines

### Introduction Section
- Start with information-prominent citations for broad context
- Use author-prominent when introducing key contributions
- Alternate every 2-3 sentences

### Literature Review / Related Work
- Use author-prominent for detailed comparisons
- Group similar works with information-prominent citations
- Maintain 50/50 balance overall

### Methods Section
- Information-prominent for established techniques
- Author-prominent when building on specific methods
- Focus on clarity over citation style

### Results and Discussion
- Information-prominent for benchmark comparisons
- Author-prominent when contrasting with specific studies
- Use reporting verbs strategically

## 5. Common Reporting Verbs for Author-Prominent Citations

**Neutral**: demonstrate, show, present, describe, report, observe
**Agreement**: confirm, support, validate, corroborate, reinforce
**Disagreement**: challenge, contradict, dispute, question, critique
**Extension**: extend, expand, build upon, develop, advance
**Innovation**: propose, introduce, pioneer, devise, formulate

## 6. Checklist for Citation Balance

Before submitting each section, verify:
- [ ] At least 30% author-prominent citations
- [ ] At least 30% information-prominent citations
- [ ] No more than 3 consecutive sentences with same citation style
- [ ] No dangling citations without author names
- [ ] Variety in reporting verbs used
- [ ] Natural flow between citation styles

## 7. Examples of Poor Citation Practices to Avoid

```latex
% TOO MONOTONOUS - all information-prominent
Previous work has shown various approaches [34]. Better results were achieved in subsequent studies [35]. The field has evolved significantly [36-38]. New methods have been developed [39-41].

% TOO REPETITIVE - all author-prominent with same structure
Smith et al. [42] propose... Johnson et al. [43] propose... Lee et al. [44] propose...

% DANGLING CITATIONS
[45] demonstrates... % NEVER do this
The method in [46] achieves... % Include author: "The method by Wang et al. [46] achieves..."
```

## 8. Advanced Citation Techniques

### Contrasting Citations
```latex
While traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted features [47-49], Park and Kim [50] demonstrate that learned representations significantly outperform these methods.
```

### Progressive Citations
```latex
Early work established the theoretical foundations [51], which Chen et al. [52] later extended to practical applications, culminating in the recent breakthrough by Rodriguez and Martinez [53].
```

### Grouped Author Citations
```latex
Several research groups (Thompson et al. [54]; Davis and Wilson [55]; Kumar et al. [56]) independently arrived at similar conclusions regarding...
```

Remember: The goal is natural, varied academic writing that engages readers while properly attributing all sources.
