# General Appendix (appendix.tex)

## üìé CRITICAL DISTINCTION: General Appendix vs AI Report

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS THE GENERAL APPENDIX!** Not the AI Usage Report.

### Two Different Types of Appendices:

1. **General Appendix (THIS FILE - `appendix.tex`)**
   - **Purpose**: OPTIONAL supplementary technical material
   - **Content**: Extra results, extended proofs, additional figures/tables, detailed derivations
   - **Example**: "Extended sensitivity analysis results", "Additional experimental data"
   - **Status**: OPTIONAL - Only include if you have overflow content from main sections

2. **AI Report Appendix (DIFFERENT FILE - `appendixAIReport.tex`)**
   - **Purpose**: MANDATORY disclosure of AI tool usage for ethics/compliance
   - **Required by**: Competition rules or journal ethics policies
   - **Content**: Lists of AI tools used, specific queries, compliance statements
   - **Example**: "We used Claude Code Opus 4 for code generation..."
   - **See**: `prompts/prompts_AIReport` for AI usage report instructions

**DO NOT MIX THESE UP!** If you need to declare AI usage, use `appendixAIReport.tex`, NOT this general appendix.

## Instructions for General Appendix

### When to Include a General Appendix

Include a general appendix when you have:
- Extended mathematical proofs too long for the main text
- Additional experimental results that support but aren't critical to main findings
- Detailed parameter sensitivity analyses
- Extra figures or tables that provide supplementary insights
- Technical implementation details not essential to understanding the method
- Raw data tables or extended datasets

### What NOT to Include

Do not include:
- AI usage declarations (use `appendixAIReport.tex` instead)
- Core results essential to your conclusions (these belong in main sections)
- Redundant information already presented
- Filler content just to make the paper longer

### LaTeX Structure

```latex
\section*{Appendix: Supplementary Materials}

\subsection*{A. Extended Sensitivity Analysis}

[Content showing how model behaves under various parameter settings beyond what was shown in the main results section]

\subsection*{B. Additional Experimental Results}

[Tables or figures with extra experiments that support but don't change main conclusions]

\subsection*{C. Mathematical Derivations}

[Detailed proofs or derivations that were summarized in the methods section]

\subsection*{D. Implementation Details}

[Technical details about algorithms or code that interested readers might want but aren't essential for understanding the approach]
```

### Examples of Appropriate Content

#### Example 1: Extended Results Table
```latex
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Extended comparison of model performance across 50 additional test scenarios}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Scenario & Our Method & Baseline 1 & Baseline 2 \\
\hline
Urban-21 & 0.945 & 0.867 & 0.823 \\
Urban-22 & 0.938 & 0.855 & 0.819 \\
... (additional rows) ...
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

#### Example 2: Detailed Mathematical Proof
```latex
\subsection*{Proof of Theorem 3.2}

We provide the complete proof of convergence for our algorithm.

\textbf{Proof:} Let $\{x_k\}$ be the sequence generated by Algorithm 1. We will show that...

[Multiple pages of mathematical derivation]

Therefore, the algorithm converges to the global optimum with rate $O(1/k^2)$. $\square$
```

#### Example 3: Additional Figures
```latex
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/extended_heatmap.png}
\caption{Heat map showing model performance across extended parameter range $\alpha \in [0, 100]$ and $\beta \in [0, 50]$, supplementing Figure 3 in the main text.}
\end{figure}
```

### Special Considerations

#### For Competition Papers
- Keep appendix concise - judges have limited time
- Focus on material that strengthens your solution
- Ensure it doesn't exceed page limits if specified

#### For Journal Papers
- Can be more extensive but should remain relevant
- Consider journal's supplementary material policies
- May be published as online-only supplement

### Compilation Instructions

1. Write content to `appendix.tex`
2. Extract any citations used:
   ```bash
   ~/.venv/ml_31123121/bin/python ../utilityScripts/extract_section_citations.py \
     --section appendix.tex --master ref.bib --output appendix_refs.bib
   ```
3. Create wrapper for review:
   ```latex
   \documentclass{article} % or appropriate class
   \input{preamble} % your preamble settings
   \begin{document}
   \input{appendix}
   \bibliography{appendix_refs}
   \end{document}
   ```
4. Compile: `pdflatex appendix_wrapper.tex`

### Review Checklist for General Appendix

After completing the general appendix:
- [ ] All content is supplementary, not essential
- [ ] No duplication with main sections
- [ ] Figures/tables are properly referenced
- [ ] Mathematical notation is consistent with main text
- [ ] Content enhances but doesn't change main conclusions
- [ ] File is named `appendix.tex` (not `appendixAIReport.tex`)

Remember: This is for OPTIONAL supplementary material only!
