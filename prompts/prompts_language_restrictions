# Language Restrictions for AI Detection Prevention

## Prohibited Words List

To prevent AI detection, avoid using the following words and phrases in academic papers:

### Overused AI Indicators
- Innovative
- Meticulous
- Intricate
- Notable
- Versatile
- Noteworthy
- Invaluable
- Pivotal
- Potent
- Fresh
- Ingenious

### Adverbs to Avoid
- Meticulously
- Reportedly
- Lucidly
- Innovatively
- Aptly
- Methodically
- Excellently
- Compellingly
- Impressively
- Undoubtedly
- Strategically

### Additional AI-Characteristic Terms
- Scholarly (when used as an adjective for approach/method)
- Robust (when overused)
- Comprehensive (when overused)
- Cutting-edge
- State-of-the-art (when overused)
- Novel (when overused)
- Significant (when overused without quantification)

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of using these words:
1. Use specific, concrete descriptions
2. Provide quantitative measures
3. Use field-specific technical terminology
4. Focus on factual statements rather than qualitative assessments
5. Let results speak for themselves rather than using superlatives

## Examples

### Bad (AI-detected)
"This innovative approach meticulously analyzes the intricate relationships..."

### Good (Human-like)
"This approach analyzes the relationships between variables using regression analysis..."

### Bad (AI-detected)
"The noteworthy results impressively demonstrate..."

### Good (Human-like)
"The results show a 23% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods..."
